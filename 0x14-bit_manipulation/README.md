in this project we are required to learn about C- Bit manipulation.
task 0 requires me to write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
the prototype provided is unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
   where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
   the function is required to return the converted number or 0 if 
         .there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
         .b is NULL
TASK 1 :i am required to write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.


the prototype provided is void print_binary(unsigned long int n);


TASK 2: i am required to write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
  the prototype provided is int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured
 TASK 3: i am required to write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
